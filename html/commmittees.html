					<h1>United Nations Security Council</h1>
					<p>
						The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of a threat to the
peace or act of aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it by
peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of settlement.
In some cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing sanctions or even
authorize the use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security. Like the UN as a whole, the Security Council was created after World War II
to address the failings of the League of Nations in maintaining world peace. The
UNSC is the only UN body that can enforce resolutions that binding on all member
states. 193 UN Member States are part of the Committee, with 15 members
entitled to a vote, and 5 permanent members of the committee

					<h1>All India Political Party Meet</h1>
					<p>
						All India Political Party Meet (AIPPM) features politicians from different parts of India. It has
the scope of incorporating all political leaders regardless of the assembly they are elected
to (for example Mamata Banerjee and Narendra Modi can be in the same conference
even though the former is a member of the West Bengal legislative assembly, and the
latter is a member of the Parliament). Unlike other Indian parliamentary committees, AIPPM is not a simulation of a legislative body and, hence, does not follow the standard
RoP of Indian parliamentary committees. The aim of AIPPM is to judge the participants on
the current political scenarios of India while also taking into consideration the art of
diplomacy. Bilingualism in AIPPM allows participants to display their proficiency in both
English and Hindi.

					<h1>War Cabinet</h1>
					<p>
						The War Cabinet, recognising each delegate's pivotal role, is committed to preventing the
outbreak of war at all costs, thereby strengthening global peace and fostering universal
brotherhood. We encourage you to be unabashed and bold in presenting your viewpoints, as your contributions are the very impetus for our committee. Apart from sound research
on the agenda, delegates are advised to be aware of their country's historical background
and strictly instructed to present their arguments, keeping the freeze date in mind. Delegates should strictly stick to their country's foreign policies and not alter the historical
course of events before the freeze date.

					<h1>International Press</h1>
					<p>
						The distinctive feature of an IP Committee is that, as much as in any Model United Nations
simulation, in the actual United Nations as well, it is an integral ‘modular’ component of the UN, which means, that the UN functionaries and their offices virtually effect only a modicum of
implementation, because it is the IP that promulgates the international resolution. The
delegations legislate and substantiate policy, but the instrument to annunciate, assert and ascribe
to the policy to form opinion, and to comment or criticize. The chief distinction between the periodicals of UN and the press is that the press seeks to 
capture what happens during the committee, the individual stances of the delegations, the
ramifications on the UN and the global demographic as a whole, as well as seasoned opinion and
well-established arguments, substantiated by statistics. The UN reports perform only the last
function, publishing out statements and statistics projected with various methodology. The
rasions d’être of the IP Committee is to assimilate the proceedings, its outcomes and transcribe it
for the public.
